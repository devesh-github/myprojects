Programming Solution - Auction House
===========================================

** Execution: **

The solution has a trigger point as AuctionDriver. This class reads the input file path from property file
and reads the data line by ine as its time based solution. Upon reading the file it calls one of its services
mentioned below through BidProcessor to handle the population/calculation/execution of data.

BidProcessor:
It gives abstraction layer to overall service layer. Works with input params provided.

Services ::
BidStartService: It handles the SELL records
BidPopulationService: It handles the actual BID population and internal logic
BidExecutionService: Based on the CLOSE_TIME, this service finalizes the BID and output the same

TestCases:
AuctionDriverTest1: To test end to end logic
BidProcessTest: To test service wise logic
These 2 cover overall logic of the solution

Trigger Point:
AuctionDriver's main method can be called to run the overall program.

Input/Output:
input.txt: Consists of the input data
output.txt: Consists of the output data

Properties file:
application.properties: Keeps all properties of the program
